# Introduction to JavaScript and Its Role in Web Development

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become an essential part of web development.

## Role in Web Development

1. Client-Side Scripting:

   - JavaScript runs in the user's browser, allowing for dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
   - It enables interactive features like form validation, animations, and responsive user interfaces.

2. Server-Side Development:

   - With Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side, allowing for full-stack JavaScript development.

3. Front-End Frameworks:

   - Popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are built with JavaScript, enabling the creation of complex, scalable web applications.

4. Enhancing User Experience:

   - JavaScript allows for the creation of responsive and interactive web pages, improving overall user experience.

5. API Integration:
   - It facilitates communication with web services and APIs, enabling data exchange between the client and server.

# Variables and Data Types in JavaScript

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, we declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

```javascript
let name = "John";
const age = 30;
var isStudent = true;
```
